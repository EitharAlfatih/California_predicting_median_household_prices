"This script takes in a filepath to a CSV, performs relevant wrangling, 
and then splits the CSV into training and testing data (80% and 20% respectively), 
and then saves training and testing data as CSVs to respective specified filepaths.

Usage: scripts/wrangle-and-split-data.R --filepath_in=<filepath_in> --filepath_out_train=<filepath_out_train> --filepath_out_test=<filepath_out_test>

Options:
--filepath_in=<filepath_in>   Path (including filename) to source data file (from load_data.py)
--filepath_out_train=<filepath_out_train>   Path (including filename) to where the training data should be saved
--filepath_out_test=<filepath_out_test>   Path (including filename) to where the testing data should be saved
