## About

This project focuses on predicting median housing prices in the difference [census blocks](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2011/07/what-are-census-blocks.html) in California based on [data collected during the 1990 Census](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices/kernels). The independent variables cover different attributes such as location, demographics, and attributes of the homes. The dataset that we analysed had an additional categorical variable added by [Aur√©lien Geron](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/tree/master/datasets/housing).

Since this dataset is publicly available, there have been many analyses. We have chosen to focus on [Eric Chen;s analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/ericfeng84), who had obtained a model score of 0.60 with linear regression. We aimed to expand on this analysis and look into the role of multicollinearity on Chen's results. The results report can be found below - we concluded that the best model was KNN with a score of approximately 0.75.

## Usage

There are two recomended methods for running the relevant files for this analysis:

### Using Docker

To use Docker, you must [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

Clone this repository locally and navigate to the root of the directory at the command line.

To create the analysis, run the following (note the complete analysis may take up to 15 minutes and to build the docker image it may take up to 30 minutes):

`docker run --rm -v /$(pwd):/cali_housing gptzjs127/dsci_522_group_312 make -C cali_housing all`

To reset the analysis, run the following:

`docker run --rm -v /$(pwd):/cali_housing gptzjs127/dsci_522_group_312 make -C cali_housing clean`

### Using Make
